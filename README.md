# ItemBancEngine
This is a software structure designed with a purpose to create a value baseline 
based on live data of the pricing of basic human need items around the world.
The data is reported directly and then used to compare values of national dollars using
algorithms similar to PPP(purchasing power parity).
This initial test uses only 14 items.
See https://itembancindex.io for more detail.
